    "Typically we don't know statistics about a population itself; the only way to know these for sure would be to survey the entirety of the population which is typically impractical. For example, to know the true salary mean of individuals in the United States, we would have to survey each and every individual.\n",
    "\n",
    "In lieu of being able to know the true underlying population statistics, we estimate them. Point estimates are estimates of population parameters based on sample data. For instance, if we wanted to know the average age of registered voters in the U.S., we could take a survey of registered voters and then use the average age of the respondents as a point estimate of the average age of the population as a whole. \n",
    "\n",
    "The average of a sample is known as the sample mean. Sampling distribution can be thought of as relative frequency distribution with a large number of samples. A relative frequency distribution tends to approach the sampling distribution as number of samples increase."

    "\n",
    "In order to learn the **population mean**, we dont measure the whole population. Instead, we take a random sample and use **sample mean, ( x_bar or $\\bar{x}$ )** to estimate population mean **( mu or μ )**. The sample mean is usually not exactly the same as the population mean and depends upon the values of samples chosen, however the population mean remains fixed. While using **sample mean** to estimate population mean, we come across **sampling error**, which directly relates to the **standard deviation** of a sampling statistic (e.g. mean values). This difference can be caused by many factors including poor survey design, biased sampling methods and the randomness inherent to drawing a sample from a population.\n",

In order to estimate a population parameter (i.e. mean) with a high level of accuracy, We must reduce the spread or the sample error which is simply the standard deviation of the samples from the sample mean. The size of samples must be set carefully in order to avoid excessive values for standard error to gain a high level of confidence in our population estimates. "
